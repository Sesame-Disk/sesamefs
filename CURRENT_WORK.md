# Current Work - SesameFS

**Library rollback ghost recovery (2026-09-11, `fix/library-rollback-ghost-projections`):**
closes `ISSUE-LIBRARY-ROLLBACK-GHOST-PROJECTIONS-01`. New-library rollback
now writes `library_rollback_pending` before the HEAD LWT introduced by #214,
then runs idempotent derived cleanup and drops the marker. A Server-owned
reaper (`RecoverPendingLibraryRollbacks`) rediscovers crash state from
Cassandra and **re-enters `deleteUnpublishedLibraryRow`**; the marker does
not authorize cleanup. The reaper is bounded and fair (clustering cursor +
rotating start bucket). Independent of `GC_ENABLED`. Soft-delete / trash
cascade was not used (`InitializeLibraryHeadIfUnset` interaction). Group-library
creation resumability remains a separate issue.
**PC-1 (2026-09-11, `feat/pc1-publication-coordinator-skeleton`):** the
`PublicationCoordinator` skeleton and the common publication types now exist
in `internal/publication` (standard-library only, no I/O): `AttemptIdentity`
(attempt id and target commit kept separate — Sync mints a fresh UUID, v2
reuses the commit id), the tri-state `HeadOutcome` with `UNKNOWN != KNOWN_LOSER`
and "only KNOWN_LOSER authorizes attempt cleanup" codified, the
`SettlementDisposition` rule (`promote` / `cleanup-attempt` / `retain`), the
opaque `PublishableInput` / `DependencyEvidence` boundary with only the
candidate `WorkSetScopeNewlyLive` declared, `Phase` labels with no order, and
a zero-field `PublicationCoordinator` whose only method is the pure
`SettlementFor`. **Zero funnels migrated, zero runtime change, zero productive
importers, zero schema/CQL/CL/TTL/GC change.** No existing HEAD classifier
(`InitialHeadOutcome`, v2 sentinels, Sync errors) was converted: the §9 mapping
in [`docs/PUBLICATION-PROTOCOL-CHARACTERIZATION.md`](docs/PUBLICATION-PROTOCOL-CHARACTERIZATION.md)
shows one v2 shape whose classification would change, so the unification stays
a separate PR. `TestPC0PublicationCoordinatorTypeIsNotImplemented` was retired
and replaced by six `TestPC1*` source contracts in
`internal/db/pc1_publication_coordinator_contract_test.go` (exactly one
declaration, zero productive importers, no funnel references, stateless and
storage-free package, inventoried method set, PC-0 inventory content pinned);
the mutation suite grows to 18/18. Status after PC-1:

```text
PC-0: CLOSED / characterization complete (#211)
H1:   CLOSED (#214)
PC-1: CLOSED (this branch)
Inherited dependency decision (ISSUE-PC0-INHERITED-DEPENDENCY-CONTINUITY-01): OPEN, required before PC-2
PC-2: NOT STARTED
W2:   OPEN
R31:  OPEN
G4:   OPEN
X1:   OPEN
GC_ENABLED=false
```

Next: resolve the inherited-dependency decision with evidence; then PC-2
(migrate CreateFileFromBlocks / shared Once preserving stage < repair <
final exact-P revalidation < HEAD); H4 (GC Phase 5) before any GC activation;
H5 before X1.

**PC-0 (2026-09-09):** publication-protocol characterization on
`docs/pc-0-publication-protocol-characterization`. Inventory, observed
partial-order kernel, multi-DC matrix, and source contracts only. No
coordinator implementation, no production behavior change. The target
coordinator contract requires classified input to become publishable before
stage: `BORROWED` must acquire durable own `up:`, while rejected
`UNPROVENANCED`/`ERROR` must not enter `stage pub:`. Current Sync can stage
before its scope gate discovers those outcomes; that is a W2 gap, not an
observed universal ordering. Verdict in
[`docs/PUBLICATION-PROTOCOL-CHARACTERIZATION.md`](docs/PUBLICATION-PROTOCOL-CHARACTERIZATION.md):
`PROCEED WITH COORDINATOR`. W2/R31/X1 remain OPEN. `GC_ENABLED=false`.

**H1 (2026-09-11, `fix/h1-conditional-head-initializer`):** PC-0 merged
(#211). The H1 follow-up is implemented: `FSHelper.InitializeLibraryHeadIfUnset`
(`IF head_commit_id = null AND created_at != null`) is the only HEAD
initializer; `InitializeLibraryFS` and Sync `createInitialCommit` publish
through it (tri-state outcome; UNKNOWN never cleans up nor rolls a library
back; a demonstrated KNOWN_LOSER discards its attempt-unique commit row,
best effort, and so does a definitive rejection — missing or invalid row —
whose CAS demonstrably never published it), `GET /commit/HEAD` returns the Paxos-settled HEAD from a
blind DC only once its commit is locally servable. Evidence: unit +
default-stack integration + real 3-DC handler-level
(`scripts/h1-initial-head-multidc-validation.sh`).
`ISSUE-LIBRARY-INITIAL-HEAD-CONCURRENCY-01` resolved; coordinator prerequisite
met. Second review round (same day) closed 4 more runtime gaps found by three
independent audits: the classifier now recognizes the real native-protocol-v4
CAS-timeout shape (`RequestErrWriteTimeout`/`RequestErrWriteFailure` with
`WriteType: "CAS"`, not just v5's `CAS_WRITE_UNKNOWN`); the three creation
handlers no longer answer a `503 Retry-After` that a retry could not honor
(it minted a new library) — they preserve the library and answer an honest
`500` with the preserved `repo_id`, and durable resumption is split out as
`ISSUE-GROUP-LIBRARY-CREATION-RESUMABILITY-01` (a `pending_group_library_creations`
marker was tried, audited as a separate idempotency subsystem, and parked on
`feat/group-library-creation-claims`); `SettleAdoptedInitialHead` attempts the
KNOWN_LOSER's best-effort commit discard before the adopted-HEAD visibility
check, not after; and a definitive (non-ambiguous) CAS rejection now discards
its own now-orphaned attempt-unique commit row. See
[`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#issue-library-initial-head-concurrency-01)
for the full writeup. Registered
`ISSUE-LIBRARY-HEAD-ADOPTED-TREE-VISIBILITY-01` as a separate follow-up:
adopting a blind-DC HEAD only proves its `commits` row is locally servable,
not the tree behind it. Next: PC-1 skeleton (done 2026-09-11, see above); H4
(Phase 5) before any GC activation; H5 before X1.

**PC-0 deep audit (2026-09-10, ninth pass):** every claim re-verified in
Docker, including the #210/#213 3-DC evidence scripts (4/4, 6/6) and the
PC-0 gate. Verdict stands. Four characterization gaps closed, no runtime
change: (1) `head_commit_id` has six writers, two of them unconditional
`UPDATE` initializers outside the CAS domain — reproduced reverting an
LWT-published HEAD from a blind DC on the real 3-DC fixture; prioritized
separate follow-up, coordinator prerequisite
(`ISSUE-LIBRARY-INITIAL-HEAD-CONCURRENCY-01`, PC-0 §3.4); (2)
revert/restore reclassified as content-resurrection publication paths
(`ISSUE-PC0-CONTENT-RESURRECTION-PUBLICATION-01`, §3.5); (3) GC Phase 5
cascade deletes fs_objects shared with HEAD —
`ISSUE-GC-PHASE5-CASCADE-SHARED-FSOBJECTS-01`, **P0 latent, PRE-GC**,
refutes "ordinary GC protects inherited dependencies" as-is; (4) §11/§12
precision (`ISSUE-PUBLISH-HEAD-TREE-STATS-COST-01`). Plus
`ISSUE-PUBLISH-REPAIR-REACHABILITY-CONVERGENCE-01` (P1, PRE-X1). New source
contracts, a GC characterization test, a 3-DC reproduction script, and 9/9
mutation legs.

**Current baseline (2026-09-10):** `main` at `7b9102af9` contains merged #209/#210/#212/#213. #212 implements G3 canonical retirement on the GC side and is orthogonal to the publication funnels; no PC-0 funnel re-characterization is required.

**PC-0 audit pass (2026-09-09):** branch rebased onto `main` (now contains
merged #209/#210). Re-characterized §7/§8/§11/§13 against #210's merged
`BlockReferenceExistsEachQuorum` cross-DC fallback (the doc previously still
said "#210 not in this baseline" after the rebase had already landed it —
stale). Registered a new finding, `ISSUE-PC0-INHERITED-DEPENDENCY-CONTINUITY-01`:
`PublishableInput` only covers dependencies newly live on a HEAD, not
dependencies inherited unchanged from the old HEAD whose continuity R3's own
`LogicalPositiveBlockDelta` note already flags as possibly unproven. Fixed
`TestPC0PublicationCoordinatorTypeIsNotImplemented` from a literal
`strings.Contains("type PublicationCoordinator struct")` scan of 3 fixed
directories to an AST walk over all of `internal/` matching any
`PublicationCoordinator` type declaration (struct, interface, alias, or
generic). Corrected the W2-status vocabulary line to R3's actual
`PROVEN_CONTINUOUS`/`CONDITIONAL`/`UNGUARDED`/`UNKNOWN` (was a shortened
`PROVEN`/`CONDITIONAL`/`UNKNOWN`). Re-scoped `ISSUE-PC0-EXACT-P-FUNNEL-GAP-01`
from `CHARACTERIZATION-PR` (ambiguous with "introduced by this PR") to
`FOLLOW-UP / W2`.

The W2 post-HEAD slice also has a separate 3-DC reachability leg
(`scripts/w2-post-head-multidc-validation.sh`); it is independent of the
existing X2/P3 GC harness and proves that local blindness cannot authorize
cleanup of a publication made in another datacenter.

**PC-0 second audit pass (2026-09-09):** the integration matrix harness had
not been updated in step with the doc's own #210 re-characterization (M2/M3/M8
still said "#210 not in this baseline"); fixed to `PRIOR-EVIDENCE-NOT-RERUN`/
`MIXED`. F8/F9's CL/Cost rows, §12's cost table, and PUBL-7 did not carry
#210's LOCAL_QUORUM-miss-escalates-to-EACH_QUORUM cost/availability trade-off;
added an explicit cost-bucket breakdown and corrected PUBL-7's error-vs-miss
framing. Introduced `ExpectedP` as distinct from the final exact-P
revalidation: the candidate boundary previously read as if `BORROWED`'s
exact-P check ran in the adapter before staging (reopening the W1 TOCTOU);
clarified that adapters only capture `ExpectedP`, and the final check runs in
the coordinator's readiness step after stage and before HEAD, with its order
relative to repair kept funnel-specific.
Corrected `TestPC0PublicationCoordinatorTypeIsNotImplemented`'s comment, which
overclaimed detection of a `type X = PublicationCoordinator` alias (RHS name)
the AST walk does not resolve. Made the HEAD-caller inventory walk
`internal/api` recursively instead of listing two fixed directories. Fixed the
M3 mutation's CRLF-broken Perl pattern in
`scripts/pc0-publication-inventory-mutation-validation.sh` (the three original
mutation legs in that pass now run RED). Aligned the inherited-dependency sequencing with
`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: resolve `ISSUE-PC0-INHERITED-DEPENDENCY-CONTINUITY-01`
before PC-2, not "PC-1 or later."

**PC-0 fourth audit pass (2026-09-10):** confirmed and corrected the remaining
characterization drift: §3.1 now describes Sync provenance as the complete
LQ→EQ scope gate; §14 and this file distinguish the observed current kernel
from the target `PublishableInput` boundary; F3 includes its session-claim
LWT in the coordination cost; M7 includes Sync's provenanced exact-P path;
the inventory walks all of `internal/`; funnel mappings call their first
column characteristic seams rather than a universal `prepare` phase; and the
negative consistency pin has a diagnostic message. The current PC-0 mutation
script had four legs, and all four were expected to turn RED. The two existing
PC-0-only source contracts for tree classification and the nil stored-upload
fence are listed in the test plan. No runtime behavior changed.

**PC-0 fifth audit pass (2026-09-10):** reconciled the remaining audit findings
against source: final `ExpectedP` validation is documented after stage and
before HEAD, with repair order kept funnel-specific; F3's full successful
request now includes the optional committed-session slot-release LWT; and
`ensureCommitBlockOwnLiveness` is documented as a plain quorum upsert that
renews or recreates the same `up:` row, not a read hit/miss. The production
function inventory now fails closed on duplicate path/function keys instead of
silently replacing a method receiver. Today's Sync global-miss behavior remains
an explicit W2 gap, not a claim that Sync rejects unprovenanced input. The
opt-in PC-0 3-DC gate was then executed against
`docker-compose.cassandra-3dc.yaml` after migrating its RF-1 keyspace:
`dc-na`, `dc-eu`, and `dc-asia` all connected and M1–M8 were recorded (M9 added by the ninth pass);
the temporary runner and fixture volumes were removed afterward. No runtime
behavior changed.

**PC-0 sixth audit pass (2026-09-10):** rebased onto `main` at `d95eec8d6`
(the merged #213 baseline) and re-characterized the shared repair classifier:
HEAD observation is `SERIAL`, ancestry is at most 1024 sequential
`EACH_QUORUM` reads under one 30-second context, and inconclusive evidence is
`UNKNOWN`/retain. M3/M4 now include #213's one-DC-unavailable retention and
later-HEAD ancestor evidence without closing M6 or broader R31. Corrected the
M1 matrix wording so F3's session-claim LWT is not omitted, softened the PR
inventory claim to its documented lexical named-call scope, and changed the
inherited-dependency tracker wording from "not addressed" to "not resolved".
No runtime behavior changed.

**PC-0 seventh audit pass (2026-09-10):** confirmed the inventory gap for
package-level function-valued variables and extended
`pc0ParseProductionFuncs` to index `var = func` literals; the mutation
validation now has five RED legs, including that exact publisher shape.
Added an explicit durable-repair seam to every mapped block-bearing funnel and
a contract freezing `stage < durable repair < HEAD`; the empty-file/no-dependency
case is documented as the only no-row degeneration. Reworded the kernel across
the characterization, R3, and changelog documents so readiness is optional but
repair is not when physical block dependencies exist. Corrected the
post-#213 `onlyOfficeCommitReachable` statement and advanced the stale issue
registry/index dates. No runtime behavior changed.

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-11
**Session**: PC-1 PublicationCoordinator skeleton and common publication types, branch `feat/pc1-publication-coordinator-skeleton` (from `main` at `db81de5f4`, post #211/#214). Previous session: PC-0 multi-DC publication protocol characterization (PR #211), branch `docs/pc-0-publication-protocol-characterization`. This pass reconciles the latest audits against the current source; no coordinator implementation or production behavior change.

Twelve independent audit rounds hardened this slice. Round 2: the fan-out calling the scope gate had no cancellation (`syncCommitProvenancedBlockIDs` now uses `errgroup.WithContext`, bounding a degraded datacenter's blast radius to at most `syncCommitBlockPlacementConcurrency` (20) block-level provenance checks admitted/in flight, instead of O(N)); the real 3-DC all-cross-DC-hit cost scenario was missing from the characterization. Round 3: the consistency guard pinned the named constant's *value* but not that `BlockReferenceExistsEachQuorum` actually *binds* it (`TestBlockReferenceExistsEachQuorumBindsTheNamedConsistencyConstant` + mutation M15 close that); the cost benchmark reused overlapping block slices across N, letting an earlier scenario's `EACH_QUORUM` query silently heal a shared block's local visibility before a later scenario reused it (fixed with disjoint per-N block sets and an explicit locally-blind precondition check before each timed measurement); cost-test cleanup was best-effort (`t.Logf`) instead of fail-closed; and the scope-gate-only cost numbers were being read as if they were the full end-to-end HEAD-readiness cost for a recovered block, which they are not (the rest of #206's pipeline -- `ProbeBlockReuse`, renewal, exact-P validation -- still runs for a recovered block, though all of it stays `LOCAL_QUORUM`/session-inherited, not newly WAN-bound). Round 4: `SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_W2_SYNC_PUTBLOCK_XDC_EVIDENCE` was missing from `TestMain`'s evidence-gate chain; the round-3 cleanup fix only reached the cost fixtures, not the single-block correctness fixture (generalized into one three-surface, continue-on-failure `t.Errorf` helper shared by both); the round-3 causal claim about the 3.4-5.0s-to-1.67s change was backwards (a healed block skips the WAN hop, which should make the contaminated run faster, not slower -- the old number is retired, not explained); "real inter-datacenter distance" language was replaced with "real 3-DC Cassandra fixture" throughout; and the "confirmed by the project owner" trade-off claim, which had no corroborating GitHub record, was re-confirmed directly by the owner in a live session. Round 5: the disjoint-set cost number varies far more than one sample suggested -- five further runs of the real 3-DC script observed N=1000 between 1.67s and 8.1s on the same fixture and code, so no single number in this doc is "the" cost, only the query count (exactly N fallback `EACH_QUORUM` reads for N clean local misses, at most 20 concurrently in flight -- not `2N` counting the always-first `LOCAL_QUORUM` reads too) is exact; the bounded-fail-fast unit test accepted up to `2x` the documented concurrency bound before failing (tightened toward exactly `syncCommitBlockPlacementConcurrency`) and was renamed from `...StopsSchedulingAdditionalWork` to `...StopsAdditionalDBProbes` since goroutines are still created, they just skip the external call; `docs/TESTING.md`'s cost-fixture default (1111, not 1000) and `docs/OPEN-WORK-INDEX.md`'s remaining "real inter-DC distance" phrase were also stale. Round 6: the round-5 test tightening overshot -- asserting `got == 20` claimed a lower-bound runtime guarantee that does not exist (only "at most 20" is real; the test's own uniform-latency mock is why 20 was observed every time), loosened to `got > 20` failing; "exactly `⌈N/20⌉` waves...confirmed every run" overstated a continuously-refilled `errgroup.SetLimit` pool as discrete synchronized batches, reworded to "N reads, at most 20 concurrently in flight, wall-clock scales roughly with N/20"; and `docs/R3-LIVENESS-CONTINUITY.md` said the fallback's cost is "bounded by the local-miss rate for provenanced blocks," when it actually runs -- and costs the same -- for genuinely-unprovenanced (dedup) blocks too, since the scope gate cannot tell the two apart before running it. Round 7: leftover `⌈N/20⌉ waves`/"round trips" framing survived in three more places round 6 hadn't touched (this file, and two other paragraphs in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`), reworded to "N fallback reads, at most 20 concurrently in flight"; the dedup case was said to pay "essentially the same" cost as the measured all-cross-DC-hit numbers, when only its query count and availability dependency are actually identical -- its own wall-clock was never separately measured, softened accordingly; `sync_w2_putblock_xdc_provenance_cost_test.go` called the real 3-DC fixture itself "WAN-separated" (it's the same single-Docker-host fixture every other round's fix already stopped calling that) and called the single-DC characterization a "lower bound on latency" (too strong -- nothing here proves any production topology's latency floor), both corrected; and `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceFn`'s doc comment said a global miss means a block "genuinely has no PutBlock provenance," contradicting the function's own top-line description ("currently has a *live*... reference") and the still-open `ISSUE-SYNC-PUTBLOCK-EXPIRED-PROVENANCE-01` (provenance past its 48h TTL is indistinguishable from never-existed) -- corrected to "no currently observable live provenance." Round 8: three more spots in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` carried the exact overclaims round 7 had already fixed elsewhere in the same file -- the Fix section's own "genuinely unprovenanced" line, the hotpath follow-up's "same cost applies" to dedup, and a dangling reference to a "15-20x multiplier estimate" whose actual number no longer existed anywhere in the document after an earlier round's rewrite -- all fixed or removed. Round 9: the scope-gate cost table was still called "the right *lower bound* for how long until HEAD can be attempted," overclaiming given the same table's own documented 1.67s-8.1s variance; reworded to "the measured scope-gate component of the total HEAD-readiness cost." "One concurrency wave" survived in six more live-doc/code spots (this file's own Round 2 clause, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` x4, `docs/R3-LIVENESS-CONTINUITY.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, and the production comment in `internal/api/sync.go` itself) despite round 6 establishing that `errgroup.SetLimit` is a continuously-refilled pool, not discrete waves -- all reworded to "at most `syncCommitBlockPlacementConcurrency` (20) provenance DB probes in flight" (itself superseded by round 11's further correction to "block-level provenance checks admitted/in flight," since each admitted check may issue both a `LOCAL_QUORUM` and an `EACH_QUORUM` read, not one probe each). Left alone: the dated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` historical entry, two mentions of an unrelated feature's own "finalize wave" (chunked-upload permit, not this fan-out), and one spot in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`'s hotpath follow-up describing a genuinely different, actually-discrete-barrier mechanism (the four sequential pipeline stages) where "wave" is an accurate description. Round 10: a real scope leak, not wording -- `syncCommitProvenancedBlockIDs` (and the `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceFn` it calls) was already shared, on `main`, by both the pre-HEAD gate (`ensureSyncCommitBlockPublicationReadiness`) and the post-HEAD best-effort renewal (`renewSyncCommitBlockOwnLivenessBestEffort`, used only by the already-reachable-commit repair path). Adding the EACH_QUORUM fallback to that shared function silently gave the post-HEAD path a new cross-DC availability dependency it never had and does not need. That path runs on `repairPublishedSyncCommitBlockDelta`'s idempotent retry path, which stages its own fresh `pub:` handshake before this call and does not assume the commit's permanent `block_references` already exist here (this repair exists precisely to heal a prior publish whose finalize did not complete, so they may not yet). The issue this PR closes is a gap in the pre-HEAD gate specifically; the post-HEAD renewal had no such gap on `main` (it was already `LOCAL_QUORUM`-only, correctly, unrelated to what this PR fixes), so the right move is to preserve its exact prior behavior -- a missed renewal there costs nothing but a delay until the next opportunity -- rather than fold it into the pre-HEAD fix's scope, unlike the pre-HEAD gate's one-shot, correctness-bearing decision before an irreversible HEAD CAS. Split into two explicit functions -- `syncCommitProvenancedBlockIDs` (pre-HEAD, `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceFn`, can reach `EACH_QUORUM`) and the new `syncCommitProvenancedBlockIDsLocalOnly` (post-HEAD, the new `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceLocalOnlyFn`, `LOCAL_QUORUM` only, matching `main`'s original behavior exactly) -- sharing only the small union/bounded-concurrency helper `syncCommitBlockIDUnion`, not a parameterized scope-gate call: an earlier attempt to parameterize instead of duplicate broke `TestR3SyncPutBlockReadinessDeclaredExceptionIsFrozen`'s static call-graph walk, which cannot resolve a function value passed as an argument back to its concrete callee. `TestRenewSyncCommitBlockOwnLivenessBestEffortNeverEscalatesToEachQuorum` freezes the split with a poison-pilled pre-HEAD seam. Also reworded the R3 guard's own violation message, which said "never SERIAL/EACH_QUORUM" without noting that check is scoped to the walked api-side wrapper code, not the separately-tracked `allowedDBCalls` allow-list that already permits `BlockReferenceExistsEachQuorum` by name. Round 11: the round-10 test only froze which package-level var `renewSyncCommitBlockOwnLivenessBestEffort` calls -- both vars were mocked, so `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceLocalOnlyFn`'s own real body never ran; a future edit rewriting that body to call `BlockReferenceExistsEachQuorum` would have stayed green. Added `TestSyncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceLocalOnlyFnBodyNeverReachesEachQuorum`, a source-contract test parsing the real body for exactly what it calls. Round 10's own justification for the split also claimed the post-HEAD path's commit is "already durably protected by its own permanent `block_references`" -- not necessarily true: `repairPublishedSyncCommitBlockDelta` exists precisely to heal a prior publish whose finalize did not complete, so those permanent refs may not exist yet when the best-effort renewal runs; the real justification is simpler -- this path was already `LOCAL_QUORUM`-only on `main`, unrelated to the gap this PR closes, so it is preserved as-is rather than expanded into scope. Corrected in `sync.go` and here. The bounded-fail-fast contract still said "at most 20 provenance DB probes," which reads as a cap on total database reads; the actual guarantee is at most 20 block-level provenance *checks* admitted/in flight after cancellation, each of which may itself issue both a `LOCAL_QUORUM` and an `EACH_QUORUM` read, and a check already past its own `ctx.Done()` gate is not cancelled mid-flight. Reworded in `sync.go`. Round 12: an external audit found round 11's own new test was itself still fragile -- it located `syncBlockHasOwnLivenessProvenanceLocalOnlyFn`'s body via a textual `"\n}\n"` boundary search and a substring blocklist on the literal word `EachQuorum`, which would not catch a future rewrite routing through a differently-named global helper (for example the existing `BlockHasReferencesGlobal`) or a body containing a nested block the boundary search misjudged. Replaced with an AST-based guard: it parses `sync.go` with `go/parser`, locates the real `*ast.FuncLit`, and walks every call in its body with `go/ast.Inspect` against a positive allow-list (only `h.db.BlockReferenceExistsLocalQuorum` and the pure referrer-key helper `syncBlockUploadReferrer` may be called) that fails closed on anything else, confirmed by temporarily swapping in `BlockHasReferencesGlobal` and observing the test fail before reverting. Also found round 11's "block-level provenance checks admitted/in flight" wording fix had only reached `sync.go` itself: `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (three spots), `docs/R3-LIVENESS-CONTINUITY.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, and this file's own Round 2 and Round 9 clauses still read "(20) provenance DB probes in flight" as if it were a cap on total database reads -- all reworded to match, with the Round 9 clause explicitly marked superseded rather than silently rewritten. A `sync.go` comment claiming a clean `LOCAL_QUORUM` miss is itself "(logged, does not block the repair)" was also wrong -- only an error return is logged, by `repairPublishedSyncCommitBlockDelta`, never a clean miss -- corrected. In the PR body, the tenth-round section's residual "cross-DC replication converges in seconds, and the next renewal opportunity sees it locally" justification (no such guarantee exists or is needed) was replaced with the real one -- the post-HEAD repair's own fresh `pub:` handshake, not the best-effort `up:` renewal, is what protects the current reconciliation attempt -- and the third-round section's `1.67s (authoritative...)` causal claim, already contradicted by the fourth- and fifth-round sections below it, was explicitly marked superseded instead of left standing uncorrected in place.

**The remaining architectural question -- whether genuinely-unprovenanced (dedup-only) blocks correctly depend on every datacenter's availability now, since a local miss can't be told apart from genuine absence without the fallback itself -- was raised explicitly as a decision the project owner, not the implementing agent, needed to make.** Confirmed 2026-09-09: ship as scoped, accept the trade-off. `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` has the full analysis of why no cheaper alternative exists within scope (a plain `QUORUM` fallback is unsafe with one replica per DC; strengthening the `up:` write itself would impose an unconditional cost on every `PutBlock`) and the explicit confirmation record.

Real 3-DC evidence: RED without the fallback, GREEN with it, one-DC-down fails closed, and the disjoint-set all-cross-DC-hit cost methodology at N=1/10/100/1000 (N=1000 observed 1.67s-8.1s across runs on this local fixture -- exactly N fallback `EACH_QUORUM` reads, at most 20 concurrently in flight, is the exact formula; wall-clock is not). 15/15 mutations (M1-M15) produce the expected RED. Does not touch expired provenance, GC, G1-G5, or X1; `GC_ENABLED=false`.

The preceding G1 (PR #207, merged), G2 (PR #209, merged; PREPARED-to-COMMITTED handoff writing a durable exact `(P,D)` recovery root before PREPARED, aborting or promoting PREPARED through the exact D authority, stopping `processBlock` at COMMITTED without physical deletion -- root reconciliation directly settles PREPARED rows including roots older than the bounded `_by_day` scheduling window, root `first_seen_at` write-once and reused on replay), and W2 post-HEAD publication continuity sessions remain historical context; their mechanisms are unchanged by this slice.

**Docker validation contract (W2)**: unit, contract, mutation, and nine-leg integration evidence runs are Docker-only. The existing X2/P3 multi-DC harness is a separate workflow and is unchanged by this branch. The canonical `go-integration-test` and `go-all-test` commands set `SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_W2_POST_HEAD_EVIDENCE=1` explicitly in their command, never permanently in the service environment; this prevents directed runs from inheriting unrelated evidence gates. The W2 gate fails if the real Cassandra/MinIO run does not execute shared-engine success, crash-after-applied-HEAD, ambiguous-applied, ambiguous-unknown-retain, lease-expiry, synchronous CAS-loser cleanup, reachable-ancestor, restart-replay, and the real pre-HEAD `CreateFileFromBlocks` repair race. `GC_ENABLED=false` remains required in every DC.

**Current W2 post-HEAD slice**: `pub:` staging and the durable repair row precede the HEAD CAS; the repair cold path reads the canonical org-scoped HEAD with SERIAL and immutable parents with EACH_QUORUM under #213's 1024-node/30-second bound. The shared repair classifier uses #213's bounded tri-state reachability classifier. OnlyOffice retains its separate legacy boolean ancestry traversal and remains outside that narrow closure. Positive reachability promotes `pub:` to `fs:`; every non-reachable, incomplete, or unavailable observation retains the repair row and does not actively remove its artifacts. The `pub:` reference still has its finite 35-day TTL; discoverable zero-ref transition remains the separate R31 follow-up. Definitive CAS losers use the request-local synchronous cleanup path. This slice does not claim W2/R31 closure for other publication funnels or broader lifecycle/GC contracts.

**W2 Sync PutBlock -> HEAD slice (2026-09-07, branch `fix/w2-sync-putblock-head-continuity`):** the branch now closes the scoped direct-HEAD safety path for currently observable PutBlock provenance. Canonical IDs are resolved positionally once and split per file; liveness and exact placement are renewed/validated with bounded concurrency before HEAD; auto-merge is contract-tested to complete readiness before queueing repair intent; a readiness failure creates no durable repair row, and once readiness succeeds and the row is queued, queue ambiguity, ambiguous-CAS, and divergent-CAS outcomes do not authorize clearing it -- only successful settlement does; auto-merge IDs include a fresh UUID attempt ID; and an opt-in post-CAS crash barrier preserves staged state for replay. Expired-provenance continuity and the remaining W2/R31 rows stay OPEN. The new integration file has five primary legs plus an explicit crash/restart/replay leg gated by `SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_W2_SYNC_PUTBLOCK_HEAD_CRASH_EVIDENCE=1`; no claim is made that the optional leg passed unless that gate is run. No G1/G2/GC protocol or schema changes; `GC_ENABLED=false`.

**📏 File Size Rule**: Keep this file under **500 lines** unless unavoidable. Move detailed content to:
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Detailed bug tracking
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Session history

**PROJECT STATUS**: ~85-90% production ready (see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`)

### ⚠️ Read this distinction before quoting any blocker count

Two different gates get confused constantly, and conflating them is how "X1 is
the only blocker" turns into "X1 closed → ship it":

| Gate | Blocked by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Activating destructive GC** (`GC_ENABLED=true`) | **X1 alone.** X2 closed 2026-08-14. | X1 OPEN; architecture frozen in D0, not implemented |
| **Putting SesameFS in production at all** | **Independent security / resource findings that have nothing to do with GC** | Several open — see below |

X1 is the sole blocker for the *first* row **only**. It is not the sole
production blocker, and no status document should say that it is.

**🔴 PRODUCTION BLOCKERS** (Must complete before deploy):
1. ~~**OIDC Authentication**~~ - ✅ **COMPLETE** (Phase 1 - Basic Login)
2. **Destructive Garbage Collection** - 🔴 **BLOCKED** by X1 physical-delete ABA — the sole blocker *for activating deletion*: X2 cross-DC reference visibility closed 2026-08-14 (destructive liveness at `EACH_QUORUM` behind a topology gate, proven on a real three-DC cluster). Keep `GC_ENABLED=false` on every replica in every DC; the implementation and lease exist but are not permission to activate deletion.
3. ~~**Monitoring/Health Checks**~~ - ✅ **COMPLETE** (Structured logging, `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`)
4. **Non-GC readiness findings** - 🔴 **OPEN**, independent of X1. Canonical status per id in [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md), one-screen list in [docs/OPEN-WORK-INDEX.md](docs/OPEN-WORK-INDEX.md). Single-node HIGHs still open: `ISSUE-RECVFS-DECOMPRESSION-AMPLIFICATION-01`, `ISSUE-SYNC-FSID-WORK-AMPLIFICATION-01`, `ISSUE-APIKEY-READ-SCOPE-UPLOADLINK-FILESHARE-01`. Multi-instance additionally requires `ISSUE-UPLOAD-CHUNK-MULTINODE-01` and `ISSUE-SSO-PENDING-TOKEN-NODE-LOCAL-01`. (`ISSUE-LIBRARY-MUTATION-NO-PERMISSION-CHECK-01` closed 2026-08-22.)

**Then review**:
1. **"What's Next"** → Top priorities (work on #1 unless user specifies)
2. **"Frozen Components"** → What NOT to touch (breaks desktop clients)
3. **"Critical Context"** → Essential facts to remember

### Quick Context
1. **Sync Protocol**: Baseline-verified for the current desktop sync hardening scope. Do not treat it as frozen; compatibility-sensitive follow-up coverage still exists.
2. **Backend API**: ~98% complete by surface count, which is not the same as ready — see blocker #4 for the open authorization/resource findings. OIDC ✅, GC implementation present; destructive activation blocked by X1 alone (X2 closed 2026-08-14), Library Settings ✅, Monitoring ✅, Departments ✅, Admin Panel (groups/users) ✅, OIDC Group/Dept Sync ✅, Tag cascade ✅, Admin Link Management ✅, Upload Links ✅, Org Admin Panel ✅, Superadmin Departments ✅, Custom Share Permissions ✅
3. **Frontend UI**: ~85% complete (all modals migrated, About modal rebranded, File History UI ✅, History Download ✅, Snapshot View ✅, Restore from History ✅, Share Dialog all 8 tabs ✅, permission UI ~75% with granular flags, ~51 ModalPortal wrappers to clean up, folder icons ✅). Plans/permissions Phase 3 is in progress, not closed.
4. **Test flow**: Prefer Docker-first validation. `./scripts/test.sh sync` now runs the single-client sync suite plus the real active-active desktop harness; default behavior is fail-fast and `--keep-going` is opt-in.
5. **Current risk shape**: destructive GC must remain disabled fleet-wide. Of the two confirmed live-data safety blockers, X2 is closed (fix proven on a real three-DC cluster, regression mutation-verified) and X1 remains open — so the *deletion-activation* gate genuinely rests on X1 alone. The upload-fence PR series addresses separate writer/GC races and does not close it. **Product go-live is a different gate** and is not held by X1: see the table above and blocker #4.
6. **X1 design state:** accepted architecture is frozen in [`docs/GC-X1-PHYSICAL-LIFE-HANDOFF-PLAN.md`](docs/GC-X1-PHYSICAL-LIFE-HANDOFF-PLAN.md) (D0, 2026-09-02). That is a documentation freeze, not X1 closure and not GC activation. Historical option comparison remains in [`docs/GC-X1-CLOSURE-OPTIONS.md`](docs/GC-X1-CLOSURE-OPTIONS.md) and is **not** the active roadmap. #199/#200 are characterization evidence only; W1 now consumes the #200 BorrowedFS result in the writer path. `GC_ENABLED=false` is pinned explicitly in `docker-compose.prod.yml`. The current branch contains the W2/R31 post-HEAD repair slice, G1 exact `(P,D)` identity and durable recovery discovery, and G2 PREPARED-to-COMMITTED handoff; G4-G5 and X1 remain open; G3 canonical retirement is implemented by #212. This branch does not activate destructive GC.
7. **Current X1/P3 key:** P1 locator authority merged 2026-08-21 (PR #181), P0/R12 landed 2026-08-23 (PR #183), and P2/R9/R24 closed 2026-08-24 after its structural prerequisite (PR #184). This branch implements the P3 writer boundary: existing-incarnation PUTs revalidate exact `(storage_class, storage_key)` authority immediately before PUT, and metadata repair is non-creating and tuple-bound. Docker evidence for R10/R13/R17 is green, including a deliberate-mutation run in which reordering the fence reads, making the repair create-capable, re-tagging a permanent failure as retryable, or restoring SERIAL to the dedup path each turns a gate red. The cross-DC half of the consistency contract is now MEASURED on the real three-datacenter fixture (`scripts/x2-multidc-validation.sh --p3`): with dc-na down neither fence publication may complete, a fence published in dc-eu blocks a dc-na writer, and both weaker publication levels turn the fail-closed leg red — the `QUORUM` mutation being what the third datacenter exists for. Fence reads pin their own consistency so the argument does not depend on `database.consistency`, which accepts `ONE`. R13's P3 writer boundary is GREEN. Strict A+ sequential-life / keep-canonical-until-delete is SUPERSEDED as the X1 closure target by D0 physical-life handoff; it is not an OPEN residual of `StartBlockDeleteOrphan`. R18/R27 are explicitly open in CURRENT production because rejected `up:` references are retained and deferred-orphan rescheduling is not implemented; D0 marks the old postpone-and-reproject design `PENDING RE-EVALUATION`. Keep `GC_ENABLED=false` on every replica in every DC.

8. **Current X1/P4a key:** this branch binds the destructive claim to the exact physical incarnation and to a per-attempt owner. Migration `017` puts `storage_key` on `gc_block_candidates` and its `_by_day` projection; `EnsureBlockGCCandidate` captures it from the canonical row and refuses to write a candidate it cannot name a `P` for. The claim CAS is `IF storage_class = ? AND storage_key = ? AND gc_state = null AND gc_claim_id = null AND gc_claimed_at = null`, `claimID` is a fresh UUID per ATTEMPT (`blockDeleteClaimID` is deleted and its absence is gated), and release, stale takeover, finalize and candidate cleanup all condition on the exact tuple. `ClaimBlockDelete` returns a classified outcome, so a non-applied CAS is no longer read as completion. Evidence is green on real Cassandra under `SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_P4A_EVIDENCE=1` (four legs: exclusive ownership with exact takeover, the ABA case, retry semantics, and stale-claim release bound to the observed incarnation), with deliberate mutations red via `scripts/p4a-mutation-validation.sh` (see the count below). **P4a snapshot (historical):** R14a GREEN, R16 GREEN, R20 PARTIAL; at that merge R14b was still OPEN and the orphan path had not yet settled in the serial domain. **Current:** R14b GREEN (#194 / P4b-2). `StartBlockDeleteOrphan` is bound to exact stored `(P,D)` and is not an untouched residual keeping strict A+ non-overlap OPEN. That sequential-life target is SUPERSEDED by D0. X1 remains OPEN. Technical debt #21 and #22 are closed; #23 (GC no longer sweeps metadata-free stubs) and #24 (pre-017 candidate rows need a fresh zero-ref decision, not a backfill) are opened as follow-ups, #24 being a PRE-ACTIVATION requirement rather than a merge blocker. A second review pass found and fixed four defects in the first cut: the stale takeover re-read the row instead of CASing against the authority it observed (so a P1 worker could drop P2 fence); the same hole existed at the owner-agnostic pre-check call site, reachable with no clock skew; the orphan publication and the S3 delete took their locator from an ordinary post-claim re-read rather than from the claim; and ErrBlockCandidateTargetUnavailable was fatal at all three enqueue sites, which was self-poisoning on the fs_object path. The deliberate mutations are red — the script reports its own current total, and the evidence update below is authoritative for it; two of them earned their keep by exposing a non-compiling mutation and a store/mock mirror with neither copy protecting the other. One behavioural narrowing to be aware of: GC no longer deletes metadata-free stub rows, because it has no exact authority over a row with no locator — an unclaimed stub is not an upload fence, and the only producer of a `deleting` metadata-free stub was the old claim CAS. The writer path does claim metadata-free rows, under `gc_state='repairing_stub'`, and cleans up its own; those are not a delete fence and were never GC's to touch. A third review pass closed the last claim-side hole: `releaseBlockClaim` collapsed `BlockReleaseNotOwner` into a bare `nil`, so a late loser — an attempt whose claim was taken over while it worked — walked through the "re-referenced after claim" unwind and consumed the CURRENT owner's candidate. Nothing about the candidate changes in that race (same block, same `P`, same `candidate_at`), so the exact-`P` CAS cannot refuse it; the wrapper now returns the outcome and settlement requires `BlockReleaseReleased`. R16 is GREEN only with both entrances closed — `BlockClaimFreshOwner` at the claim and this one at the release. Landed with it: the post-claim stub branches (driven by an ordinary read the claim had already contradicted in the serial domain, and DLQ-bound with the fence up) are gone in favour of hand-back-and-postpone; `GCFailureCodeBlockAuthorityInvalid` was documented as postponing but was never in `shouldPostponeWithoutRetry`; and the grace postpone and an unnameable claim owner got their own codes. Keep `GC_ENABLED=false` on every replica in every DC.

**P4a evidence update (2026-08-27):** This supersedes every earlier P4a status wording in
this file and every earlier mutation count. The script output is authoritative.
`internal/integration/p4a_claim_authority_test.go` has four real-Cassandra legs: exact
ownership/takeover, physical ABA, retry under real CAS, and stale-claim release bound to
the observed incarnation. `scripts/p4a-mutation-validation.sh` prints its own total on a
clean run — cite that, not a number copied from prose.

**P4a claim visibility (2026-08-28):** After an uncertain LWT, SERIAL seeing our own
`claimID` is not `BlockClaimAcquired`. Production confirms the canonical `blocks` row at
`EACH_QUORUM` (exact P, `deleting`, claim id, `claimed_at`) before granting destructive
authority — the same split P4b-1 uses for orphan `SameTarget`. Direct `applied=true`
stays Acquired. That confirmation read requires effective `blocks.read_repair=BLOCKING`
(empty is not the default); source/schema and `SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_P4A_EVIDENCE=1` pin it.
Mutations `m_settled_own_claim_skips_each_quorum`,
`m_settled_claim_visibility_downgrades_to_local_quorum`,
`m_claim_loses_explicit_non_idempotent_pin`,
`m_claim_loses_zero_retry_policy`,
`m_claim_loses_non_speculative_policy` and
`m_blocks_disables_blocking_read_repair` hold those gates. The mock follows the same
exact classifier, including `claimed_at`, and the initial claim LWT explicitly disables
driver retries and speculative execution.

**Audit hardening files (2026-08-28):** `internal/gc/store_mock.go`,
`internal/gc/store_cassandra.go`, `internal/gc/p4a_claim_ownership_test.go`,
`internal/gc/p4a_claim_authority_guard_test.go`,
`scripts/p4a-mutation-validation.sh`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and
`CURRENT_WORK.md`. Docker validation passed the full 50-mutation P4a/R26 matrix and the
full short Go suite.

A fourth review pass closed ordinary post-claim `GetBlockInfo` errors and divergent
locators: each now releases the exact claim, preserves the candidate, and postpones
without consuming retry budget.

A **fifth** pass closed the other half of the same principle. Preserving the candidate
only preserves recovery while a work item can still carry it back, and five post-claim
unwinds — the global verify's non-availability branch, a non-canonical `storage_class`, an
empty/untrimmed `storage_key`, a failed `GetBlockStoreForOrg`, a rejected
`ValidatePhysicalLocator` — released the fence and then returned an ordinary error without
looking at whether the fence was still theirs. A late loser therefore spent the item's
retry budget, and at the cap `ItemBlock` reached a DLQ it never leaves, past a scanner day
cursor already advanced to `today-1`: candidate present, work item unreachable, foreign
fence standing. An item already near the cap needed ONE lost race. All five now return a
classified foreign-owner result on `BlockReleaseNotOwner` (`refuseRetryForForeignClaimOwner`
/ `releaseClaimThenFailWithRetry`), and `processOrg` leaves the stale queue row untouched,
while an attempt that still owns its claim spends retries exactly as before, so a permanent
item defect still reaches the DLQ where a human sees it. Gated by
`TestP4A_ForeignOwnerUnwindDoesNotSpendTheRetryBudget`,
`TestP4A_OwnedUnwindStillSpendsTheRetryBudget`,
`TestP4A_LateLoserDoesNotTouchAnAlreadyAdvancedQueueRow` and
`TestP4AForeignOwnerQueuePolicyPrecedesGenericLifecycle`, plus two new mutations.

The same pass found the mutation gate itself half-open: `m_enqueue_item_mints_block_candidate`
matched literal `\n\t\t` against a CRLF working tree, so it silently applied NOTHING and
aborted the run before the remaining mutations were reached. Fixed to whitespace runs, per
the rule the script's own header states.

P4a remains R14a GREEN / R16 GREEN / R20 claim-side PARTIAL. P4b-2 now carries that
claim authority through orphan publication and finalize: `CommitBlockDeleteOrphanHandoff`
is the irreversible commit on `blocks`, resume is `CommittedOwner` of the stored D, and
`SameAuthority` / `DifferentAuthority` replace same-P-only `SameTarget`. **Explicitly still
open:** X1 itself, R18/R27, P4c-orphan PK, and enabling GC. `GC_ENABLED=false` remains required.

**Queue lifecycle review update (2026-08-27):** The attempted generic LWT hardening of
`RequeueItem` is withdrawn from this branch. `CompleteItem`, `FailItem` and `RequeueItem`
must not be presented as one atomic lifecycle: the first two use ordinary batches and a
partial CAS on requeue would create a false guarantee. `RequeueItem` is restored to the
ordinary logged `DELETE(old)` + `INSERT(new)` path; its concurrent race is a documented
follow-up, not a P4a closure claim.

The mergeable late-loser rule is narrower. `blockClaimForeignOwnerError` is handled by
`processOrg` before generic logging, retry, postpone or DLQ handling. The stale worker calls
none of `CompleteItem`, `RequeueItem`, `FailItem` or retry mutation, and its queue identity,
candidate and retry count remain unchanged. The five P4a ownership/unwind fixes remain
active, including the owned path's normal retry/DLQ behavior. `GC_ENABLED=false` remains
required while the follow-up chooses one authority for `Requeue`/`Complete`/`Fail`, DLQ and
pending state.

**P4b-1 update (2026-08-27):** `StartBlockDeleteOrphan` now publishes the canonical row
with a write-once `EachQuorum + Serial` LWT and no driver retry/speculation. Its result is
classified as `Created`, `SameTarget`, `DifferentTarget`, `NotPublished`, `Ambiguous`,
`Invalid`, `ProjectionUnconfirmed` or `LifecycleAdvanced`; same-target resumes use the stored `first_seen_at`
and repair the identity-only discovery projection only while the row is still `pending_s3`.
The worker only releases/postpones a
confirmed conflict or absent settled row; uncertain, malformed, unconfirmed projection
or advanced-phase states retain claim, candidate and queue lifecycle. Publication-invalid has its own
failure code: the untouched check runs before the postpone check, so reusing
`block_authority_invalid` would have silently taken the candidate-authority error off the
postpone path P4a had just put it on. Unit coverage and ten deliberate
mutations are green/red as required, and real-Cassandra evidence is gated by
`SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_P4B_EVIDENCE=1`. Write-once also drops the stale-phase reset.
A same-P row already at `pending_mapping_cleanup` no longer authorizes finalize; recovery
may still clear that completed-phase row without a physical delete. For that stale-phase
ambiguity itself the trade stays leak-biased until R14b binds incarnation. `SameTarget`
confirms canonical `EACH_QUORUM` visibility before finalize and does not renew TTL
(R28: crash-retry still authorizes Finalize because `Created` already inserted the
fence; remaining TTL is not a lease). `NotPublished` requires SERIAL-confirmed absence.
With a datacenter down, P3 accepts `BlockClaimAmbiguous` (err may be nil after
SERIAL settlement of an unowned row; when SERIAL sees our claim but
`EACH_QUORUM` confirmation is unavailable, the outcome is Ambiguous with a non-nil
error) and orphan `NotPublished` or `Ambiguous`; never claim
`Acquired` or orphan `Created`/`SameAuthority`. P4b-2 then binds that publication to the
exact P4a claim authority. `GC_ENABLED=false` remains required.

**P4b-2 update (2026-08-28):** R14b is GREEN. Migration `019` adds `blocks.gc_orphan_handoff`
(null until commit, never written false) and `gc_s3_orphans.gc_claim_id` / `gc_claimed_at`.
Migration `020` adds `gc_block_delete_lifecycles` (PK `((org_id, block_id), claim_id)`,
phases `published`/`terminal`, never DELETE). Do not fold 019 or 020 into
`001_initial_schema.cql`. `CommitBlockDeleteOrphanHandoff` is the irreversible commit
(EACH_QUORUM + SERIAL, exact `(P,D)`). `AlreadyCommitted` and `CommittedOwner` require
canonical `EACH_QUORUM` visibility; an empty non-applied handoff CAS SERIAL-settles.
After commit: no release, takeover, Complete, Requeue, Fail, or retry++. `CommittedOwner`
revalidates locator/store/topology, then treats `BlockHasReferencesGlobal` as a
contradiction detector (error or refs>0 → `committed_pending`; R3 stays OPEN). Orphan
publication INSERTs the lifecycle tombstone first and SERIAL-re-reads it after the
orphan INSERT; terminal D cannot recreate an authorizing orphan. Finalize
`AlreadyFinalized` requires an exact published `(P,D)` certificate and does **not**
authorize S3 — only applied `Finalized` does. Missing/mismatch/garbage certificates
fail closed. `RecoverS3Orphans` `pending_s3` SERIAL-observes D before S3 and will not
DELETE against terminal (stale-orphan clear is allowed). Production `DeleteS3Orphan`
runs only after `published → terminal`. Never-delete lifecycle partitions grow by one
row per D (operational follow-up). Evidence: unit + `scripts/p4b-authority-mutation-validation.sh`;
real Cassandra `internal/integration/p4b_claim_orphan_authority_test.go` under
`SESAMEFS_REQUIRE_P4B_EVIDENCE=1`. 3-DC P3 fail-closed: with dc-na down,
`CommitBlockDeleteOrphanHandoff` from dc-eu is Ambiguous, not
Committed/AlreadyCommitted. P4b-1's write-once script stays
`scripts/p4b-mutation-validation.sh`. X1 stays OPEN (winner-`Finalized` Physical ABA
is not closed here). `GC_ENABLED=false`.

**G2 update (2026-09-08):** PR #209 implements the D0 PREPARED-to-COMMITTED
handoff after G1. Root recovery directly settles PREPARED rows and the root token
is write-once; this does not implement G3-G5 or enable destructive GC.

**D0 update (2026-09-02):** #199 (strict non-overlap characterization) and #200
(BorrowedFS HEAD characterization) are merged as evidence-only PRs. #199 already
reasoned with independent physical lives after #185; it characterized a
conservative keep-`blocks(P1)`-until-delete strategy, which D0 supersedes
because durable exact handoff keeps authority on P1 without leaving `blocks(P1)`
canonical through cleanup. G3 Finalize vacates `blocks(L)` while `orphan(Pold)`
still fences writers; productive `blocks=P2` + `orphan=P1` is G4. Source of
record: [`docs/GC-X1-PHYSICAL-LIFE-HANDOFF-PLAN.md`](docs/GC-X1-PHYSICAL-LIFE-HANDOFF-PLAN.md).
**Still CURRENT/TRANSITIONAL:** orphan `(org,L)` writer fence, Finalize-before-S3,
recovery ref re-check, and the P4c-orphan PK. G1's exact `(P,D)` recovery identities have no TTL; G2's PREPARED/COMMITTED handoff is implemented on this branch but does not activate GC. R31 OPEN. H not
reclassified. R18/R27 pending re-evaluation. 020 stays. Activation remains A1
after E1. `GC_ENABLED=false`.

**D0 follow-up (2026-09-02):** G3 vacates `blocks` while writers stay fenced until
G4. `PHYSICAL_COMPLETE` is confirmed DELETE only (ambiguous stays COMMITTED).
PREPARED abort CAS-revokes exact D's commit capability before removing the
orphan; a SERIAL non-commit observation while D1 still owns must not delete
it. After Abort returns not-owner, classify exact D1 (promote, settle that
PREPARED, or fail closed) so Case A/B converge without TTL. G2 must not create
durable PREPARED until G1 supplies a restart-findable recovery root; G5 is
later scheduling hardening. W2's irreversible
frontier is `D committed`, not zero-proof. Minted lives are `K1 != K2`. D0
does not claim “no physical ABA”; H stays OPEN.

### Inter-session Update (2026-05-21)

- PR61 focus is desktop sync conflict hardening and closeout, not audit-log expansion.
- Sync HEAD promotion now has branch-parity coverage for both `PUT /seafhttp/repo/:repo_id/commit/HEAD` and `POST /seafhttp/repo/:repo_id/update-branch`.
- The hardening baseline is now verified for same-tree idempotence, safe non-overlapping auto-merge, and fail-closed retryable `503` behavior for unsafe conflicts.
- Real active-active desktop proof now exists via two `seaf-cli` clients in Docker hitting separate backend nodes.
- `./scripts/test.sh sync` now chains the single-client sync suite and the active-active harness; it stops on the first failing suite by default, with `--keep-going` available when you need aggregate failure reporting.
- `./scripts/test.sh` now also prints failure excerpts for compose-backed and script-backed suites, so Docker/test-runner failures are immediately visible without digging through full logs.
- Sync cleanup was tightened to release/delete stale `sync-test-*` and `sync-aa-*` libraries so the suite no longer drifts into `Library limit reached` failures.
- A broader canonical quota-reservation prototype was audited and explicitly split out of this branch; the confirmed defects are documented in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, and PR61 should keep only the test-runner improvement from that line of work.
- Remaining sync follow-up debt is narrower: deeper-tree active-active branches, quota rejection during auto-merge, and broader 3-node/org-level quota contention races.

### Step 2: Before Making ANY Code Changes
- ✅ Check `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Is component 🔒 FROZEN?
- ✅ If FROZEN → DO NOT MODIFY without explicit user approval
- ✅ If ✅ COMPLETE → Modify with caution, verify tests pass
- ✅ If 🟡 PARTIAL / ❌ TODO → Safe to actively develop

### Step 3: At End of Session - Update Documentation
**📋 MANDATORY: Run [docs/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md)**

## Current Branch Summary ✅

**Date**: 2026-05-21
**Focus**: Desktop Sync Conflict Hardening + Docker-first Validation + PR61 Closeout

### Completed In This Branch Slice

- Hardened sync HEAD publish behavior to distinguish safe same-tree retries from unsafe divergent conflicts.
- Added integration proof for both handler entry points: `PUT /seafhttp/repo/:repo_id/commit/HEAD` and `POST /seafhttp/repo/:repo_id/update-branch`.
- Added multi-instance convergence coverage for parent-promotion races during retry.
- Added a real-client active-active harness with safe auto-merge and unsafe `503` scenarios.
- Folded the active-active harness into `./scripts/test.sh sync` and made the wrapper fail-fast by default.
- Fixed `--keep-going`, active-active `--keep`, and sync test cleanup/capacity drift.
- Realigned the docs so status and testing guidance no longer contradict the code and current validation surface.

### Remaining Follow-up Debt

- Extend desktop sync coverage into deeper-tree active-active branches and quota rejection during auto-merge.
- Add broader multi-node quota-race coverage beyond the current per-user concurrent upload test.
- Keep `CURRENT_WORK.md` and related status docs synced whenever the branch focus shifts; this file had drifted badly enough to become misleading.

## Historical Session Summary ✅

**Date**: 2026-03-31
**Focus**: Frontend/Backend Split Audit + Nginx Production Hardening + Bug Fixes

### Completed This Session (Session 59)

#### Nginx frontend container — 6 production bugs fixed ✅
All were silent failures that would only surface under production load:
- `client_max_body_size 100G` at server block (was missing → nginx default 1MB blocked large uploads)
- Proxy timeouts: `proxy_read_timeout 3600s`, `proxy_send_timeout 3600s`, `proxy_connect_timeout 30s` at server block
- `proxy_buffering off; proxy_request_buffering off` on transfer routes (`/d/`, `/u/d/`, `/lib/`, `/repo/`, `/seafhttp/`)
- `proxy_http_version 1.1` + `proxy_set_header Connection ""` on all proxy locations (HTTP/1.1 keepalive)
- `sendfile on; tcp_nopush on; tcp_nodelay on` at server block
- `gzip_vary on; gzip_comp_level 6`

#### Nginx production reverse proxy — improvements ✅
- Upstream keepalive: `keepalive 32/16/8` on all 3 upstream blocks
- Separate rate limit zone for file transfers (`transfer` zone 20r/s vs `api` zone 100r/s)
- Content-Security-Policy header added
- All `add_header` directives now use `always`
- `client_max_body_size 100G` (was 20G)
- Frontend location: `proxy_send_timeout 3600s`, `proxy_connect_timeout 30s`

#### Bundle hash coupling fix ✅
- `internal/api/v2/sharelink_view.go` — `fetchBundleManifest()` fetches `asset-manifest.json` from
  frontend container at startup. 3-level fallback: HTTP → filesystem scan → hardcoded.
  `FRONTEND_URL` env var added to both docker-compose files.

#### Logout fixes ✅
- `internal/api/server.go` — `handleLogout` now calls `SessionManager.InvalidateSession(token)`
  before clearing cookie and redirecting (server-side session was never invalidated before)
- `frontend/src/components/common/logout.js` + `account.js` — clear `sesamefs_auth_token` and
  `custom_permissions_*` from localStorage on click (was left behind after backend redirect)

**Files changed**: `frontend/nginx.conf`, `nginx/nginx.conf.template`, `internal/api/v2/sharelink_view.go`, `internal/api/server.go`, `frontend/src/components/common/logout.js`, `frontend/src/components/common/account.js`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `docs/V1-PRODUCTION-ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `CURRENT_WORK.md`

### Previous Session (Session 55) — Org Admin Panel + Superadmin Parity

**Date**: 2026-03-05

#### Org Admin Panel — Full Implementation ✅

Implemented complete org admin panel in `internal/api/v2/org_admin.go` with 50+ endpoints covering:

- **Users**: CRUD, password reset, owned/shared repos, search, import, invite (12 endpoints)
- **Groups**: CRUD, members, group libraries, search (13 endpoints)
- **Repositories**: List, delete, transfer, browse dirents (4 endpoints)
- **Trash Libraries**: List, clean, delete single, restore (4 endpoints)
- **Departments & Address Book**: List departments, full address book group CRUD with ancestors (6 endpoints)
- **Group Owned Libraries**: Create + soft-delete (2 endpoints)
- **Share Links**: List + delete with org ownership verification (2 endpoints)
- **Upload Links**: List + delete with org ownership verification (2 endpoints)
- **Devices**: Empty responses — no device table (3 endpoints)

**Performance fixes applied:**
- `resolveUsersMap()` — batch user resolution replacing N+1 queries
- No ALLOW FILTERING — `ListOrgGroupLibraries` iterates org libs + checks shares by partition key
- `sort.Slice` — replaced O(n²) bubble sort in `ListOrgRepos`
- Group quotas stored in `organizations.settings['group_quota_{groupID}']`

#### Superadmin Parity — Departments/Address Book/Group-Owned Libs ✅

Added 9 new endpoints to superadmin panel in `internal/api/v2/admin_extra.go`:
- `AdminListOrgDepartments`, `AdminListAddressBookGroups`, `AdminAddAddressBookGroup`
- `AdminGetAddressBookGroup` (with ancestors), `AdminUpdateAddressBookGroup`, `AdminDeleteAddressBookGroup`
- `AdminAddGroupOwnedLibrary`, `AdminDeleteGroupOwnedLibrary`
- `AdminUpdateGroupMemberRole`

Routes registered in `internal/api/v2/admin.go`.

#### Documentation Updated ✅

- `docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md` — Added §4 (Superadmin departments), §5 (Org Admin Panel full docs), §6 (Parity table)
- `docs/ENDPOINT-REGISTRY.md` — Registered all 50+ org admin + 9 superadmin endpoints
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` — Updated admin panel rows, added org admin entry, updated metrics
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` — This update

**Files changed**: `org_admin.go`, `admin.go`, `admin_extra.go`, `departments.go`, `ADMIN-FEATURES.md`, `ENDPOINT-REGISTRY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `CURRENT_WORK.md`

### Previous Session (Session 54) — Upload File Replace/Autorename Fix

**Problem**: `replace=0` in upload was not triggering auto-rename (`file (1).ext`), default was overwriting.
**Fix**: Updated upload handler to check `replace` param correctly.

### Previous Sessions (53 and earlier — see docs/CHANGELOG.md)

- **Session 53**: Admin trash libraries 405 fix + cleanup handler + orphan data documentation
- **Session 52**: Retrocompat fix — pre-index users, admin `/sys/users/` multi-org fix
- **Session 45**: Superadmin script (`make-superadmin.sh`) + CreateOrganization seafile-js compat
- **Session 44**: Desktop client file browser fixes (oid header, upload/download protocol, trailing slash)
- **Session 33-34**: Admin share link + upload link management (13 endpoints) + verification
- **Session 32**: Bug fix sprint (5 bugs) + tag management enhancement
- **Session 30**: Snapshot view, revert with conflict handling
- **Sessions 22-29**: Admin panel, OIDC sync, File History UI, GC metrics, search, trash

## What's Next (Priority Order) 🎯

### 🔴 PRIORITY 1: PR61 Desktop Sync Hardening Closeout

**Status**: 🟡 Baseline verification is complete; the remaining work is merge hygiene and narrower follow-up coverage, not core sync correctness.
**Details**: `internal/api/sync.go`, `internal/integration/library_projection_regression_test.go`, `internal/integration/multi_instance_mutations_test.go`, `scripts/test-sync-active-active.sh`, `scripts/test.sh`

**Use this branch for:**

1. Running Docker-first closeout validation before merge (`./scripts/test.sh sync` first).
2. Extending the active-active sync matrix into deeper-tree conflicts or quota-rejection branches.
3. Keeping branch-status docs aligned with the validated behavior actually present in code.

**Do not let this branch drift into:**

1. Audit-log expansion.
2. Broad frontend cleanup unrelated to desktop sync.
3. New role/ownership behavior changes without a separate branch discussion.
4. Canonical quota reservation/resync experiments; keep that work in a dedicated follow-up branch.

### ✅ ~~PRIORITY 1: Admin Library Management~~ — DONE (2026-02-12)

**Status**: ✅ Complete — 12 endpoints implemented in `internal/api/v2/admin.go`
**Details**: [docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md](docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md) § 1

All admin library endpoints implemented: list, search, get, create, delete, transfer, browse dirents, history settings, shared items, trash libraries. Frontend `seafile-api.js` methods already wired.

### ✅ ~~PRIORITY 2: Admin Share Link & Upload Link Management~~ — DONE (2026-02-12)

**Status**: ✅ Complete — 13 endpoints across 5 files
**Details**: [docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md](docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md) § 2

Admin share link list/delete fixed; upload links full feature (DB tables, user CRUD, admin list/delete); per-user link endpoints; frontend API methods added.

### 🔴 PRIORITY 3: Audit Logs & Activity Logs — PRIORITIZE NEXT

**Status**: 🟡 Partial foundations exist: `audit_log` for deletion events and `users.last_login_at` for latest successful login, but no historical login/file activity dataset or APIs
**Details**: [docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md](docs/ADMIN-FEATURES.md) § 3

**Two related systems need implementation:**

1. **Audit Logs** (admin-facing): Login logs, file access logs, file update logs, permission audit logs. Needed for compliance and admin visibility. Frontend pages exist at `frontend/src/pages/sys-admin/logs-page/` and `frontend/src/pages/org-admin/org-logs-*.js`.

2. **Activity Feed** (user-facing): The `/api/v2.1/activities/` endpoint currently returns stub `{"events": []}`. The dashboard activities feed and file activity panels depend on this. Frontend components exist (`frontend/src/pages/dashboard/activity-item.js`, `frontend/src/models/activity.js`).

**What exists today:**
- `internal/middleware/audit.go` — 13 action types defined, `AuditEvent` struct, console-only logging, 8 unit tests
- `audit_log` table — persists deletion/compliance events for GC, groups, departments
- `users.last_login_at` — real latest-login timestamp updated on successful auth and exposed in admin/org-admin user responses
- Frontend UI components for both admin logs and user activity feed

**Next logical slice:**
- Implement `login_logs` first as the bridge between point-in-time `last_login_at` and real historical audit/reporting
- Reuse the successful-auth hooks already touching `users.last_login_at`
- Expose login history to the existing admin login-log pages before expanding to file/activity logs

**Explicit pending gap:**
- `/sys/statistics/file/` and `/org/statistics-admin/file/` still cannot be made real without `file_update_logs` and `file_access_logs`
- That dependency is separate from `login_logs`; login audit work does not unblock file-operation charts by itself
- There is also a confirmed scope bug in org-admin statistics: traffic-based org-admin metrics can resolve to platform-wide aggregates when the org-admin shell is mounted with platform-org context

**Remaining full backlog:**
- 5 dedicated Cassandra tables (login_logs, file_access_logs, file_update_logs, permission_audit_logs, activities) with 90-day TTL
- New `internal/api/v2/audit.go` handler file (~5 endpoints)
- Async DB write integration (buffered channel pattern) across ~15 existing handlers
- Wire up frontend pages to real API endpoints

### ~~🟡 PRIORITY 4: File History UI Wiring~~ — ✅ COMPLETE (Session 23)

Detail sidebar now has Info | History tabs for files. Full-page history also works. Integration tests: 17 assertions passing.

### 📋 PRIORITY 4: Test Coverage Improvement

**Status**: Go integration test framework built (Session 24), coverage gaps identified

**Current unit test coverage** (from `go test -cover`):
| Package | Coverage | Lines | Priority |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| `internal/crypto` | 90.8% | ~600 | ✅ ABOVE THRESHOLD (was 69.6%) |
| `internal/api/v2` | 20.5% | 14,136 | HIGH — biggest codebase, most untested |
| `internal/api` | 19.1% | 4,769 | HIGH — sync protocol edge cases |
| `internal/db` | 0% | 1,139 | MEDIUM — all DB access only via integration |
| `internal/middleware` | 42.1% | 752 | MEDIUM — permission logic |
| `internal/storage` | 46.4% | 1,561 | MEDIUM — S3/block edge cases |
| `internal/templates` | 0% | 327 | LOW — email rendering |
| `internal/logging` | 0% | 66 | LOW — instrumentation |
| `internal/metrics` | 0% | 111 | LOW — instrumentation |

**Next steps** (in priority order):
1. **Add more Go integration tests** — share links, admin endpoints, groups, batch ops (parallels existing bash tests)
2. **DB interface mock** — define `Store` interface for `internal/db`, implement mock, unlock unit tests for all handlers
3. **API v2 handler unit tests** — error paths, validation edge cases in `files.go` (3,564 lines), `admin.go` (1,462 lines)
4. **Concurrent access tests** — race detector integration tests for simultaneous uploads/downloads
5. **testcontainers-go** — real Cassandra in CI for `internal/db` unit tests

**Frontend Testing Strategy** (7 test files currently, need expansion):
- Current: `utils.test.js`, `dirent.test.js`, `modal-pattern.test.js`, `seafile-api-tags.test.js`, `seafile-api-oidc.test.js`, `permission-checks.test.js`, `dirent-list-item.test.js`
- **Metrics to track**: Component coverage (% of components with tests), critical path coverage (login→upload→share flow), API mock coverage
- **Priority areas**: Dialog components (conflict dialogs, restore dialogs), API integration layer, permission-based UI visibility
- **Tools**: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured), consider adding Cypress for E2E

### 📋 PRIORITY 5: Frontend Cleanup (Lower)

- **ModalPortal Wrapper Cleanup** — ~51 parent components have unnecessary `<ModalPortal>` wrappers (harmless, cosmetic)
- **Frontend Permission UI** — ~60% complete, readonly/guest users still see some buttons they can't use

## Frozen/Stable Components 🔒

**Freeze procedure**: See [docs/RELEASE-CRITERIA.md](docs/RELEASE-CRITERIA.md) for the formal stability rules and Component Test Map. Components need ≥ 80% Go coverage, ≥ 90% integration endpoint coverage, zero open bugs, and 3 clean sessions in 🟢 RELEASE-CANDIDATE before reaching 🔒 FROZEN.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Sync Code FROZEN (2026-01-19)
**User directive**: DO NOT MODIFY sync code without explicit approval

### Code Files - Sync Protocol 🔒
- `internal/api/sync.go` (lines 949-952, 125-130, 1405-1492) - Protocol formats
- `internal/api/v2/encryption.go` - Password endpoints

### Code Files - Crypto 🔒 (Frozen 2026-02-04)
- `internal/crypto/crypto.go` - PBKDF2, Argon2id, AES-256-CBC (90.8% unit test coverage, 39 tests)

### Code Files - Monitoring/Health 🔒 (Updated 2026-02-04)
- `internal/health/health.go` - Liveness and readiness probes 🔒
- `internal/metrics/metrics.go` - Prometheus metric definitions (GC metrics expanded Session 28)
- `internal/metrics/middleware.go` - Request metrics middleware 🔒
- `internal/logging/logging.go` - Structured logging setup 🔒

### Code Files - OnlyOffice 🔒 (Frozen 2026-01-29)
- `internal/api/v2/fileview.go` - File view auth wrapper + OnlyOffice editor HTML (json.Marshal config). Note: History download handler added (Session 25) — OnlyOffice code paths unchanged.
- `internal/api/v2/onlyoffice.go` - OnlyOffice API endpoint + JWT signing + editor callback

### Code Files - Web Downloads (Updated 2026-02-16)
- `internal/api/seafhttp.go` - `streamFileFromBlocks()` (primary download path — prefetch pipeline, 4MB buffers)
- `internal/api/seafhttp.go` - `HandleDownload()` (token validation, 4MB streaming buffer)
- `internal/api/seafhttp.go` - `addFileToZip()` (ZIP Store method, batch block resolve, 4MB buffers)

## Critical Context for Next Session 📝

### 🎯 Project Goal
**Mission**: Build complete Seafile replacement ready for production
**Target Users**: Global cloud storage, especially needing China access
**Timeline**: ASAP but thorough - "want it soon, do it right"

### 📊 Current State (Updated 2026-03-05)
- **Sync Protocol**: 100% working, desktop clients fully compatible 🔒 FROZEN
- **Backend API**: ~98% implemented — OIDC ✅, GC implementation present; destructive activation blocked by X1 alone (X2 closed 2026-08-14), Library Settings ✅, OnlyOffice ✅, Tags cascade ✅, Org Admin Panel ✅, Superadmin Departments ✅
- **Frontend UI**: ~83% functional (all modals migrated, folder icons ✅, ~51 ModalPortal wrappers to clean up)
- **Production Ready**: blocked for destructive GC until X1 closes (X2 closed 2026-08-14); keep `GC_ENABLED=false` on every replica/DC
- **Admin Panels**: Both superadmin and org admin at feature parity
- **Active Bugs**: tracked canonically in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`; X1 is the sole remaining GC blocker (X2 closed)

### Critical Facts to Remember

**Permissions System** (UPDATED 2026-01-27):
- Backend: ✅ 100% COMPLETE - All endpoints check permissions
- Frontend: 🟡 ~30% - "New Library" button done, many features remain
- API returns: `can_add_repo`, `can_share_repo`, `can_add_group`, etc.
- Check `window.app.pageOptions.canAddRepo` in render methods

**User Roles**:
- `admin` → Full access, `is_staff: true`
- `user` → Can create libraries, share, upload
- `readonly` → View only, no write operations
- `guest` → Most restricted, view only

**Test Users** (password: `password` for all):
- `admin@sesamefs.local` (token: `dev-token-admin`)
- `user@sesamefs.local` (token: `dev-token-user`)
- `readonly@sesamefs.local` (token: `dev-token-readonly`)
- `guest@sesamefs.local` (token: `dev-token-guest`)
